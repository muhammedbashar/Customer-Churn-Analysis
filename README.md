# Customer Churn Analysis
### Project Overview

This project analyses customer churn behaviour to identify key factors contributing to customer attrition and to provide actionable business insights. Using data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualisations, the project highlights patterns related to customer tenure, contract type, service usage, demographics, and payment methods.

The analysis shows that 26.54% of customers have churned, indicating a significant opportunity for improving customer retention.

### Key Insights

* Customers with short tenure (especially 1–2 months) show the highest churn rates.

* Month-to-month contracts contribute the largest share of churn, while long-term contracts have lower churn.

* Senior citizens churn at a higher rate compared to non-senior customers.

* Customers using more value-added services are more likely to stay.

* Electronic check payment users show higher churn than other payment methods.

### Business Value

The project demonstrates how churn is influenced by measurable customer behaviours rather than randomness. The insights can be used to:

* Reduce early-stage churn

* Improve contract strategy

* Increase service adoption

* Design targeted retention programs

* Improve payment experience

### Tools & Technologies

* Python

* Pandas

* NumPy

* Matplotlib / Seaborn

* Jupyter Notebook

Outcome

This project converts customer data into clear insights and business recommendations, making it suitable for real-world decision-making and portfolio demonstration.
